# Linear Regression from Scratch 💡

## What’s this? 🤔
A super simple **Linear Regression** model built from scratch using **NumPy & Pandas**! It generates random data, trains using **Gradient Descent**, and updates weights & bias step by step. 

## What it does ✨
- Creates a dataset with a true linear function 📊
- Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) 🔢
- Updates weights & bias using **Gradient Descent** 🎯
- Saves the dataset to `dataset.csv` 📂
- Shows training progress in real-time ⏳
